Hugin Mountainheart, a stout, elderly dwarf, bore his heavy-set frame with a quiet dignity, as if carrying secrets alongside his weight. Wisps of white hair crowned his balding head, a stark contrast to the long, loosely braided white beard that cascaded down his ample belly, hiding more than it revealed. Bundled in thick furs and woolen cloaks against the biting wind, he seemed prepared for more than just the cold. A glint of ancient knowledge flickered in his eyes, hinting at tales and adventures that time itself had tried to bury.
