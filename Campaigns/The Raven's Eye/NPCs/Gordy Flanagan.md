Description

The Caretaker

A burly, middle-aged man with a red grizzled beard and calloused hands, evidence of years spent in hard labor. His leather apron is perpetually smudged with soot and grease, and his weathered face is softened by a kind, approachable demeanor, always ready with a hearty laugh and a helpful hand.

Grumbly gruff demeanor

Things he could be doing:

- Patching the ceiling with mud an a trowel
- replacing floorboards
- hunting a rat with a hammer
- measuring and thinking
