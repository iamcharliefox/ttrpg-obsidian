Voltheris is a land of grandeur, where beauty and danger are woven together in a perpetual dance. Towering peaks rise sharply from the earth, their jagged cliffs standing guard over the land. Dense forests, ancient and shadowed, stretch for miles, their dark canopies hiding forgotten secrets. The coastline, rocky and unforgiving, meets the restless tides, a reminder of the land’s isolation. Yet, even amidst the harshness, there is a raw, untamed beauty that calls to the people of Voltheris, drawing them into its depths.

The tribes of Voltheris are a proud and fierce people, descendants of warriors who have long mastered the brutal elements of the land. They built grand cities from the stone of the earth, their towering spires and runic carvings a testament to an ancient wisdom and power. These cities, fortified against the storms and beasts of the wilderness, are more than mere settlements—they are strongholds of magic and learning. The people are not just warriors but also masters of the old arts. With runes, they shape the land, control the elements, and commune with the spirits that walk beneath the surface of the earth.

Though Voltheris is a land of wonder and triumph, it is not without its perils. The rugged terrain is filled with wild beasts, treacherous paths, and storms that seem to descend without warning. Yet, the people endure. They have learned to live in harmony with the land, to respect its harsh beauty, and to harness its power for their own survival.

The Voltherians do not live in isolation; they are explorers, traders, and warriors who sail the seas, braving the waves to find new lands, bring riches back to their home, and seek knowledge in distant places. The northern tribes, though often divided by their own rivalries, share a common bond—a fierce pride in their heritage and an unyielding will to defend their homes.

But the land is changing.

For as much as the people of Voltheris have built, they have yet to fully understand the forces at play beneath their feet. Beneath the surface, secrets slumber—secrets that could either save or destroy them all. They live in the shadow of the unknown, always searching for answers but never quite knowing if they truly want them.

Then came the star.

On the fateful night the star fell, it tore through the heavens, its divine fire streaking across the sky before crashing into the highest peak of Voltheris’ mountains. The ground shook, and the winds howled, heralding the arrival of something strange and wondrous. From the crater, thick mists began to rise, as if summoned by the fallen star itself. These mists, unlike any that had come before, began to crawl across the land, devouring the forests, rivers, and cities of Voltheris.

The mists carried with them a strange power—unpredictable, shifting, and uncontrollable. As they spread, the land began to change. Forests grew denser and more twisted, strange creatures appeared from the shadows, and once-ancient runes began to glow faintly in the dark.

The fate of Voltheris is sealed as the mists swallow more of the land. Once mighty, the people now wander in confusion, lost in a world they can no longer grasp. The land they once ruled is slipping away, consumed by the fog that promises only darkness. The mists claim all, and the people of Voltheris are forgotten, lost to the very world they sought to conquer.
