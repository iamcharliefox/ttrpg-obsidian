![[avatar-of-corvus-header.png]]

A powerful, menacing female figure, exuding an aura of darkness. She stands tall, clad in intricate rune covered armor with a blend of chainmail and plate, marked by bold, sharp lines. Her large, shadowy black wings are spread wide, their feathers drawn with meticulous detail, adding to her imposing presence. A plate helmet with engravings and horns, obscures her face, leaving only her piercing, malevolent eyes visible.
