Before the mists swallowed Voltheris—before the world forgot its true shape—there was Malphasia.

She was not always the thing that slithered through whispered fears, nor the shadow that gnawed at unraveling minds. Once, she had been flesh and purpose, a seer, a shaman, a speaker of the old runes. She walked among the clans of Voltheris, her furs heavy with charms of bone and iron, her voice thick with prophecy. She did not wield steel like a shieldmaiden, nor ride the winds like the Valkyries, but hers was a power far older, far darker.

She read fate in the blood of the slain. She spoke in tongues to the spirits that churned beneath the earth. She cast bones into fire and pulled the strands of destiny with her will alone.

She was chosen. A voice for the gods.

Or so she believed.

### The Night the Sky Was Torn Asunder

Then came the night when the heavens split, when the gods turned their faces away.

A star fell—a wound of fire streaking across the blackened sky, burning through the firmament itself. It struck the highest peak of Voltheris with a force that shook the bones of the world. The earth rumbled. The winds shrieked. And from the ruin, the mist began to rise—thick, endless, creeping down the mountains like a living thing.

The clans trembled. They called it a curse.

But Malphasia… Malphasia listened.

The fog coiled with whispers, voices curling like smoke through the air. The others recoiled from its touch, but she felt its pull, its hunger, its promise.

She ascended the mountain alone. Step by step, she climbed into the swirling abyss, her form swallowed by the storm of magic and madness. She sought to understand it, to claim it, to wield the power that bled from the heavens.

But the gods did not greet her there.

Something else did.

### The Unmaking of Malphasia

No mortal knows what she found at the heart of that fallen star. Some say she gazed into a great void, a wound in the fabric of existence, a thing older than time itself. Others whisper she knelt before a presence, something that had waited beyond the veil, something that now spoke through her.

When she descended the mountain, she was not alone.

The mist followed.

Her form had changed. Tall. Gaunt. Wrong. Her raven-dark hair tangled with blackened feathers, her skin pale as the death-moon, her fingers ending in talons that scraped the very fabric of reality. Her gown, woven of dead leaves, rotting moss, and withered vines, twisted as if alive, writhing with unseen purpose.

And her voice…

Her voice no longer belonged to her alone. It carried the echoes of something vast, something unknowable.

She was no longer Malphasia, the shaman.

She had become the Withered Veil.

  
### Malphasia as a Demigod
  
Malphasia is a feared lesser fae demigod of decay, treachery, and corrupt nature. A dark and brooding figure, she is worshiped by malevolent fae and twisted nature spirits. She embodies the destructive, wild, and untamable aspects of the natural world—where life fades, rot spreads, and predators lurk in the shadows.

**Appearance:**

In her true form, Malphasia appears as a tall, slender woman with raven-black feathers woven into her long, tangled hair. Her skin is pale as moonlight, her eyes glowing like molten silver, and her fingers end in sharp, claw-like talons. Her gown is made of withering vines, dead leaves, and dark moss, always seeming to writhe as if it’s alive. Wherever she steps, the ground withers, flowers turn black, and trees decay.

Malphasia can also take the form of a massive, jet-black raven, large enough to block out the sun when she flies overhead. In this form, she retains her godly presence, her glowing eyes betraying her intelligence and malice. Her raven cries can summon storms, and with each beat of her wings, the natural world decays in her wake.

**Powers & Influence:**

• Decay and Corruption: Malphasia has mastery over the darker side of nature, with the power to twist plants and animals into warped, violent versions of themselves. Forests under her influence become twisted labyrinths of thorns and overgrowth, filled with deadly plants and ravenous beasts.

• Weather Manipulation: She can summon fierce storms, bringing thunder, lightning, and rain to wash away civilizations in ruin.

• Raven Form: As a raven, Malphasia can spread her influence far and wide, using her form to spy on mortals, corrupting the hearts of nature worshipers or powerful druids.

• Control Over Beasts and Swarms: She can summon hordes of ravens, wolves, or insects that act as her eyes and ears across the land. These creatures will obey her every command, often turning the natural world against those who would defy her.

• Twisted Nature: Malphasia can cause areas under her control to become cursed with blight, where crops refuse to grow, water becomes poisoned, and predators become rabid, attacking anything that enters.

**Cult & Worship:**

Her followers are often druids or rangers who have lost faith in the natural order or those who crave power at any cost. Dark elves and evil fae sometimes revere her, seeking her favor to bend nature to their will. Her shrines are hidden in deep forests, overgrown and hidden within deadly groves where only the most devoted dare tread.

Malphasia’s worshipers sacrifice animals and sometimes even people to her, believing that blood will satiate her endless hunger for destruction and allow them to wield her corrupting power. Ravens, being sacred to her, are used as omens—flocks appearing are signs of her favor or wrath.

In battle, her followers summon her dark blessings to cause forests to turn hostile, vines to ensnare their enemies, and the very land itself to rebel.


**The Withered Veil**
Beneath the moon, before the mist,
A seer spoke where shadows twist.
With bone and charm, she read the sky,
Whispered runes where fates would lie.
A star fell down, a wound of flame,
The earth did quake, the winds did claim.
She climbed alone, through storm and strife,
To meet the void, and lose her life.
The gods were silent, yet something spoke,
A presence vast, the fabric broke.
She returned—no longer whole,
The Withered Veil consumed her soul.
Where she walks, the ground will die,
Her raven’s cry, the storm’s reply.
A voice that whispers, cold and deep,
The secrets that the shadows keep.
