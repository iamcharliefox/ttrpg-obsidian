As the ship draws closer to the outpost, the mist begins to clear just enough to reveal a rugged coastline with jagged rocks jutting out into the gray sea. The craggy shore is dotted with the silhouettes of a few rough-hewn buildings, their outlines blurred by the mist, while a crude dock emerges from the gloom. The air smells of salt and pine. The ship lurches gently as it nears the dock, and through the haze, you see the figure of a dwarf standing at the edge, waiting patiently for your arrival. The atmosphere feels both eerie and strangely welcoming.

A seasoned, stout dwarf stands in the cold, his round belly peeking out from a patched-up fur cloak. Wisps of hair flap in the wind and his cloak billows around him as he beckons for you to approach.

[[Hugin Mountainheart]] stood here.
