![[Creaking Pirate Ship at sea Soundscape. Captain's quarters after a long day of treasure hunting..mp3]]

You find yourself aboard The Bearded Maiden, a battered dwarven galleon helmed by the grizzled Captain Roary Ironfang. His thick beard, braided with iron rings, clinks softly as he maneuvers the wheel. Below deck, the gnomish device hums and pulses, its faint glow flickering in rhythm with the ley lines far beneath the waves guiding you toward the unknown.

For weeks at sea, you and your companions have endured the hardships of the voyage together—facing fierce storms, dwindling rations, and the ever-present unease of what lies ahead. Through these trials, bonds have been forged. Shared meals over weak ale, whispered stories under starlit skies, and the hard-won victories against the sea’s fury have turned you from strangers into something more.

*Introduce Characters*

Now, at last, you have reached the edge of the world as you know it.

As The Bearded Maiden glides toward the mist wall, the wind dies without warning. The ship’s sails sag, and the once-restless waves turn eerily still. A hush falls over the ship, broken only by the rhythmic creaking of the hull. Then, drifting out from the swirling fog, a small, derelict rowboat emerges, bobbing unnaturally atop the lifeless sea.

Inside the boat sits a motionless figure, slumped over. The tattered remains of their clothing suggest they were once an explorer, but their face is hidden beneath a damp hood. Their hands grip the sides of the boat—stiff, unnatural. A prickle of unease runs through the air as the mist coils tighter around the ship.

Something is wrong.

## Encounter Mechanics
![[Combat-undead.mp3]]

Phase 1: Investigating the Rowboat

If the adventurers examine the boat, they can attempt the following checks:
• Perception (DC 12) – Notice faint arcane runes etched along the wood.
• Medicine (DC 10) – Determine that the figure is dead… but too fresh for how long they must have been adrift.
• Arcana (DC 12) – Sense that the body is infused with lingering necromantic energy.

If the adventurers disturb the body, or after one minute of inaction, the corpse suddenly lurches upright, mist seeping from its empty eye sockets.

Phase 2: The Mistbound Corpse (Combat Begins, Initiative Rolled)

The figure in the boat isn’t alive… but it isn’t fully dead either. The mist clings to its form as it lunges at the nearest adventurer.

Mistbound Corpse (Undead)
• HP: 22
• AC: 12
• Speed: 20 ft.

Abilities:
1. Mist Surge (Recharge 5-6) – The corpse exudes a burst of thick fog, lightly obscuring the area within 10 feet for 1 minute.
2. Withered Grip (Melee, +4 to hit, 1d6+2 necrotic damage) – The corpse grabs a target, reducing their movement by half until they break free (DC 12 Strength).
3. Unnatural Resilience – The first time the corpse is reduced to 0 HP, it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, it rises again with 5 HP on its next turn.

Phase 3: Resolution

Once the corpse is truly defeated, the mist around it dissipates, and the rowboat begins to sink, as if its very presence was unnatural. Searching the body reveals:

• A waterlogged journal (mostly unreadable, but with cryptic notes about “watching eyes in the fog”).
• A small iron pendant, etched with the same arcane runes as the boat.

If the adventurers keep the pendant, they may experience strange whispers as they enter Voltheris…

Why This Encounter?

• Simple mechanics – One undead enemy with light environmental effects.
• Introduces the mystery of Voltheris – Who was this explorer? How did they die?
• Quick, atmospheric fight – A spooky but manageable challenge before deeper dangers.
