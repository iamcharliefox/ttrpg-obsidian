Encounter: The Wraithwood Stalker

Setup

The adventurers are traveling through an ancient, overgrown forest where the trees twist unnaturally, their gnarled roots forming treacherous paths. A persistent chill hangs in the air, and faint whispers drift through the trees, warning of an unseen menace. The party senses they are being watched.

Trigger

As the party moves deeper, they notice the faint glimmer of bioluminescent mushrooms marking a path forward. As they proceed, the air grows heavy, and a sinister laugh echoes through the woods. Suddenly, the light from the mushrooms dims, and the forest falls eerily silent.

The Creature

Emerging from the shadows is the Wraithwood Stalker, an amalgamation of forest and nightmare. This twisted creature resembles a humanoid made of blackened bark and vines, with hollow, glowing green eyes. Its limbs end in jagged claws, and it moves with unnatural speed. A faint mist of toxic spores surrounds it, making breathing difficult.

Tactics

• Ambush: The Stalker attacks the party from the trees, blending into the foliage and striking with surprise.

• Entangling Vines: As a lair action, it can animate the forest to entangle the party, forcing them to make Strength saving throws to avoid being restrained.

• Poisonous Spores: It emits a cloud of spores in a 20-foot radius, forcing a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, characters take poison damage and are poisoned for one minute.

• Shadow Meld: It can teleport between shadows, making it difficult to pin down.

Combat

The Stalker fights viciously, targeting spellcasters and ranged attackers first. It uses the terrain to its advantage, retreating into the shadows when injured. As the battle progresses, the forest itself seems to turn against the party, with branches slashing at them and the ground quaking underfoot.

Aftermath

If the party defeats the Wraithwood Stalker, they discover its heart—an amber-like orb pulsing with necrotic energy. It can be used as a rare crafting material or traded to the right person for powerful magical items. However, the death of the Stalker causes the forest to calm, and the whispers fade.

Should the party flee or fail to defeat the creature, the forest will remain hostile, and the Stalker will haunt their steps until they leave the woods or destroy it.
