Legends speak of a time, eons ago, when a mysterious object fell from the heavens, its fiery trail streaking across the sky for days. It struck the distant land of Voltheris with cataclysmic force, shattering the tallest mountain peak and sending shockwaves through the very bones of the earth. The ground quaked for days, the skies darkened for weeks, and from the mountain’s broken crown erupted a vast, unnatural mist—spreading like a living shroud, consuming the land in its ghostly embrace.

Ever since that fateful moment, Voltheris has remained obscured by a perpetual mist—thick, swirling, impenetrable. Those who dare venture near its shores speak of a wall of fog so dense that ships vanish upon entering… never to return. Even magic falters at its borders, as if the very fabric of reality bends to forces unknown. Voltheris has become a land lost to history—its shores forsaken, its name spoken only in whispers… a place of dread… and dark fascination.

But now, a new chapter begins. The Stormbreakers, a hardened faction of explorers, have discovered a way to pierce the mystical veil. They have crafted a device—one capable of detecting the hidden veins of magic that pulse beneath the ocean floor. These ancient ley lines, coursing with arcane power, glow faintly in the abyss, reveal a path through the shifting mists.

The Stormbreakers have established a foothold on the mist-shrouded shores of Voltheris. Now, they seek fearless souls—bold adventurers willing to risk everything for the promise of untold riches, lost relics, and the chance to carve their names into legend.

And so, drawn by whispers of treasure, of forgotten secrets buried deep within the veiled land… you make your choice. You enlist. And soon, your journey into the unknown begins..
